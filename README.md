# LBM_fluids

Code For simulating fluid flows with the Lattice Boltzmann Method.

The code has been tested with simulating poseuille flow, flow over a flat plate and flow past a circular cylinder. The boundary conditions that have been added to the code include periodic, halfway bounce back, complete bounce back, Zou - He's inlet condition and a simple outflow condition.
